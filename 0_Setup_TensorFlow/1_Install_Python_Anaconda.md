# Install Python & Conda:
Conda package manager gives you the ability to __create multiple environments__ with different versions of Python and other libraries. This becomes useful when some codes are written with specific versions of a library. For example, you define your default TensorFlow environment with python 3.5 and TensorFlow 1.6  with GPU by the name ```tensorflow```. However, you may find another code that runs in python2.7 and has some functions that work with TensorFlow 1.2 with CPU. You can easily create a new environment and name it for example ```tf-12-cpu-py27```. In this way you donâ€™t mess with your default environment and you can create multiple environments for multiple configurations. The figure below might give you some hints:
