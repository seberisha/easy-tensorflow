# Neural Network

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll create our first neural network classifier in Tensorflow. The implemented network architecture is presented in the following figure. You can read our step-by-step [Tutorial](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/3_Neural_Network/Tutorials/1_Neural_Network.ipynb) on writing the code for this network, or skip it and see the implementation [Code](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/tree/master/3_Neural_Network/code).

In the previous tutorial on the [Linear Classifier](https://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/), we saw that the decision boundaries generated by them to separate classes are linear! This is very limiting and performs poor when it comes to non-linearly separable data points. This gives rise to the idea of __Neural Networks__ which is like using stacks of linear classifiers linked to each other by a non-linearity (ReLU in Fig. 1). To learn more about this, read  [this](https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/) article.
