# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will implement a simple Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow
with two convolutional layers, followed by two fully-connected layers at the end. 
The network structure is shown in the following figure and has classification accuracy of
above 99% on MNIST data.

## Note
- For the step-by-step explanation of the code, checkout the 
[CNN.ipynb](CNN.ipynb).

- You may also clone the whole repo. and open the main.py file 
(which includes extensive inline comments) to run the network 
in you IDE of preference (e.g. PyCharm).

- To learn more about CNNs, we suggest the Stanford's CS231n 
Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
