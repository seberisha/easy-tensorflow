In this set of tutorials, we take the first steps toward understanding what are the basic components of TensorFlow and how they work. We assume you have the TensorFlow library and Python environment ready. If not, feel free to do so using our detailed guideline to [install TensorFlow](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/0_Install_TensorFlow/README.md).

## Tutorials:
* [1. Graph and Session: ](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/1_TensorFlow_Basics/Tutorials/1_Graph_and_Session.ipynb)
    What is a __Tensor__ and how it __Flows__ through the created structure, the __Graph__
* [2. Tensor Types: ](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/1_TensorFlow_Basics/Tutorials/2_Tensor_Types.ipynb)
    Introducing common Tensor types (_constant_, _variable_, _placeholder_) and their usage
* [3. TensorBoard: ](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/1_TensorFlow_Basics/Tutorials/3_Introduction_to_Tensorboard.ipynb)
    The Visualization Toolbox comes with TensorFlow; your flashlight in the dark world of tensor operations
* [4. Save and Restore: ](https://github.com/easy-tensorflow/easy-tensorflow/blob/master/1_TensorFlow_Basics/Tutorials/4_Save_and_Restore.ipynb)
    How to save your trained model, and load it back for later use
